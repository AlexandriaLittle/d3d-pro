      . Place *wss: Wheel Speed Sensor (Infineon TLE4996L Sensor v1.0.0)* in
      *Jig* with label facing “out” (toward window in *Jig*)

      . Slide *Wheel Speed Sensor* into *Jig* until its label aligns can be seen
      through the window in *Jig*

      . Bend *Wheel Speed Sensor* leads down along *Jig*

      . Place *Wheel Speed Sensor* pins through holes in *trrs-board: TRRS Audio
      Connector on PCB (TRRS 3.5mm Jack Breakout Board (generic) v1.0.0)* with
      the jack facing up

      . Align *TRRS Audio Connector on PCB* with lip on *Jig*

      . Bend *Wheel Speed Sensor* leads over to fix position of *Wheel Speed
      Sensor* relative *TRRS Audio Connector on PCB*

      . Remove *Wheel Speed Sensor*/*TRRS Audio Connector on PCB* sub-assembly
      from *Jig*

      . Run tests - see *Test Stand* documentation for API calls/application
      used to run these tests (there is a CLI tool to run these tests
      automatically)

      .. Verify direction

      ... it should report cw when wheel turns 20 rpm cw

      ... it should report ccw when wheel turns 20 rpm ccw

      .. Verify cadence (using average cadence)

      ... it should report 30 +/- 2 when wheel turns cw at 30 rpm

      ... it should report 50 +/- 2 when wheel turns cw at 50 rpm

      ... it should report 45 +/- 2 when wheel turns cw at 45 rpm
