    . Reproduce the {{tools.plate-jig.description}} SVG file that is located in the 'source' folder of the project documentation. The jig is a 300mm x 300mm square with 5mm radius holes centered at (15,15) (15,285) (285,15) and (285, 285).
    . One method for such reproduction is to send the file to be printed at a local printing shop (e.g. Staples, Office Depot, etc.)
    . Alternatively, the jig can be printed at home if you have access to a printer capable of printing on 12" x 12" cardstock.
    . As a final option, use poster board or cardstock, cut a 300mm x 300mm square, and draw the circles as described above.
    . Lastly, cut out the circles in each corner to create a hole for marking the work surface later.
    . The {{tools.plate-jig.description}} is now complete.

- summary: Weld the {{parts.m6-25mm-screw.description}} {{parts.m6-25mm-screw.quantityUnits}} to the {{parts.steel-sheet.description}}
  requiredParts:
  - steel-sheet
  - m6-25mm-screw

  requiredTools:
  - welder
  - vise-grip-pliers

  details: |
    . Using *{{tools.vise-grip-pliers.description}}*, secure a *{{parts.m6-25mm-screw.description}}* over one of the *{{tools.plate-jig.description}}* circles drawn previously.
    . While wearing proper safety equipment, spot weld the *{{parts.m6-25mm-screw.description}}* to the *{{parts.steel-sheet.description}}* using the *{{tools.welder.description}}*.
    . Repeat the above steps for the remaining *{{tools.plate-jig.description}}* marks until there are a total of four *{{parts.m6-25mm-screw.description}}* {{parts.m6-25mm-screw.quantityUnits}} in the locations indicated by the *{{tools.plate-jig.description}}*.
    . Clean off the welding marks on both sides of the *{{parts.steel-sheet.description}}* using the *{{tools.welding-brush.description}}*.
