- Halogen Lightbulbs require special handling. The oils on human skin can shorten the lifetime of a Halogen Lightbulb if they get on the glass of the bulb. Always use something other than your hands to handle a Halogen Lightbulb.
- If oils or other debris do get on the Halogen Lightbulb it can be cleaned with rubbing alcohol and a clean paper towel.
