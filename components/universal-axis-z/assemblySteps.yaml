    . Slide two *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} onto the *{{tools.8mm-rod.description}}*.
    . Use the *{{parts.painters-tape.description}}* to evenly cover the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} with around five layers of *{{parts.painters-tape.description}}*. Do this by applying the tape to both *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} and then rotating the {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} on the *{{tools.8mm-rod.description}}* until enough *{{parts.painters-tape.description}}* is applied.
    . Remove the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} from the *{{tools.8mm-rod.description}}*.
    . Remove some *{{parts.painters-tape.description}}* from the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} until the {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} can fit into the holes of the *{{parts.carriage-side.description}}*.
    . Test the fit of the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} by covering the open end of the *{{parts.carriage-side.description}}* with the *{{parts.carriage-closure.description}}* and then shaking the {{parts.carriage-closure.quantityUnits}}. If the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} move around inside of the *{{parts.carriage-closure.description}}* then the fit is too loose and more *{{parts.painters-tape.description}}* must be added to the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}}.
    . Repeat the above step until the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} fit into the *{{parts.carriage-side.description}}* without moving during the shake test.
    . Repeat all of the above steps for the other two *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}}.
    . Orient the *{{parts.carriage-closure.description}}* over the opening of the *{{parts.carriage-side.description}}* so that the three mounting holes on the *{{parts.carriage-closure.description}}* line up with the mounting holes on the *{{parts.carriage-side.description}}*. The flat side of the *{{parts.carriage-closure.description}}* should be facing away from the *{{parts.carriage-side.description}}* and the side with the indents for the *{{parts.linear-bearing.description}}* {{parts.linear-bearing.quantityUnits}} should be facing toward the opening of the *{{parts.carriage-side.description}}*.
    . Fix the *{{parts.carriage-closure.description}}* in place by using a *{{tools.5mm-allen-wrench.description}}* to screw a *{{parts.m6-20mm-screw.description}}* into the center hole of the *{{parts.carriage-closure.description}}*.
