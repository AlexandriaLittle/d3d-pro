      . Launch the *Slicer* software on your *Personal Computer*

      . Open the _trrs-wssm-housing-base.stl_ geometry file in the *Slicer*

      . (Optional) Suggested settings for *Slicer*, otherwise use default
      settings for selected *Filament*

      .. Create Raft = True

      .. Skirt Distance = Far (10mm)

      .. Generate Support Material = True

      .. Support Percent = 30%

      . Ensure *Filament* is loaded in the *3D Printer*

      . Print the sliced geometry following the manufacturer's instructions for
      the *3D Printer*

      . Remove the completed *TRRS Wheel Speed Sensor Module Housing Base* from
      the *3D Printer*
