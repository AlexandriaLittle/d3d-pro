*Instructions*

. Slide two *Linear Bearing* part(s) onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*.
. Use the *Painters Tape* to evenly cover the *Linear Bearing* part(s) with around five layers of *Painters Tape*. Do this by applying the tape to both *Linear Bearing* part(s) and then rotating the part(s) on the *8mm Smooth Rod* until enough *Painters Tape* is applied.
. Remove the *Linear Bearing* part(s) from the *8mm Smooth Rod*.
. Remove some *Painters Tape* from the *Linear Bearing* part(s) using *Scissors* until the part(s) can fit into the holes of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*.
. Test the fit of the *Linear Bearing* part(s) by covering the open end of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* with the *Carriage Closure* and then shaking the part. If the *Linear Bearing* part(s) move around inside of the *Carriage Closure* then the fit is too loose and more *Painters Tape* must be added to the *Linear Bearing* part(s).
. Repeat the above step until the *Linear Bearing* part(s) fit into the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* without moving during the shake test.
. Repeat all of the above steps for the other two *Linear Bearing* part(s).
. Orient the *Carriage Closure* over the opening of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* so that the three mounting holes on the *Carriage Closure* line up with the mounting holes on the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*. The flat side of the *Carriage Closure* should be facing away from the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* and the side with the indents for the *Linear Bearing* part(s) should be facing toward the opening of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*.
. Fix the *Carriage Closure* in place by using a *5mm Allen Wrench* to screw a *M6 x 20mm Screw* into the center hole of the *Carriage Closure*.

. Take the *GT2 Belt* and make a loop on one end with the teeth of the belt locking into one another.
. Insert the loop into the side of the *Belt Peg* and use a *3mm Allen Wrench* to screw a *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) into the loop.
. Thread the other end of the *GT2 Belt* through one of the openings on the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* that is closer to the *Universal Axis Idler Side*.
. Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Motor Side*, around the pulley, and back through the *module*.
. Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the open slot in the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*.
. Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Idler Side*, around the bearings, and back through the *module*.
. Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* back through the first slot of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*. Make sure that the *GT2 Belt* goes around the *Belt Peg* part in such a way that the part is positioned on the inside of the *GT2 Belt*.
. Find the section of *GT2 Belt* that overlaps itself. This section will be coming out of the first slot of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*.
. Take a *Belt Pinch* part and, while pulling the *GT2 Belt* tight by hand, slide the part over both sections of *GT2 Belt*.
. Place a *M6 Nut* in the nut catcher of the *Belt Pinch*.
. Push a *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the other side of the *Belt Pinch*. The part(s) may need to be wiggled while being pushed in.
. Gently tighten down the *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the *M6 Nut* with a *5mm Allen Wrench*. The final belt tension will be adjusted in a later step.
. The *Universal X Axis Module* is complete.

*Instructions*

. Slide two *Linear Bearing* part(s) onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*.
. Use the *Painters Tape* to evenly cover the *Linear Bearing* part(s) with around five layers of *Painters Tape*. Do this by applying the tape to both *Linear Bearing* part(s) and then rotating the part(s) on the *8mm Smooth Rod* until enough *Painters Tape* is applied.
. Remove the *Linear Bearing* part(s) from the *8mm Smooth Rod*.
. Remove some *Painters Tape* from the *Linear Bearing* part(s) using *Scissors* until the part(s) can fit into the holes of the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side*.
. Test the fit of the *Linear Bearing* part(s) by covering the open end of the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* with the *Carriage Closure* and then shaking the part. If the *Linear Bearing* part(s) move around inside of the *Carriage Closure* then the fit is too loose and more *Painters Tape* must be added to the *Linear Bearing* part(s).
. Repeat the above step until the *Linear Bearing* part(s) fit into the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* without moving during the shake test.
. Repeat all of the above steps for the other two *Linear Bearing* part(s).
. Orient the *Carriage Closure* over the opening of the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* so that the three mounting holes on the *Carriage Closure* line up with the mounting holes on the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side*. The flat side of the *Carriage Closure* should be facing away from the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* and the side with the indents for the *Linear Bearing* part(s) should be facing toward the opening of the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side*.
. Fix the *Carriage Closure* in place by using a *5mm Allen Wrench* to screw a *M6 x 20mm Screw* into the center hole of the *Carriage Closure*.
