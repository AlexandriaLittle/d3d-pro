          . Using the *Scissors*, cut four rectangles of *Carbon Fiber Blanket*
          to size (80mm x 300mm).

          . Set up the *Sewing Machine* and *Sewing Thread* by following the
          manufacturer's instructions for the *Sewing Machine*.

          . Overlap/fold one rectangle of *Carbon Fiber Blanket* so that it
          forms a 40mm x 300mm rectangle.

          . Using the *Sewing Machine*, sew the 300mm long edges of the
          rectangle together. It should form a 300mm long sleeve.

          . Repeat the previous two steps for all of the remaining *Carbon Fiber
          Blanket* rectangles.

          . Take one of the *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve* parts and use
          *Scissors* to cut "X" shapes near the ends of the sleeve. The center
          of the "X" cuts should be approx. 20mm from each edge.

          . Repeat the above step for all of the remaining *Carbon Fiber Blanket
          Sleeve* parts.

          . The *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve* parts are complete.

              . Using the *Scissors*, cut four rectangles of *Carbon Fiber
              Blanket* to size (80mm x 300mm).

              . Set up the *Sewing Machine* and *Sewing Thread* by following the
              manufacturer's instructions for the *Sewing Machine*.

              . Overlap/fold one rectangle of *Carbon Fiber Blanket* so that it
              forms a 40mm x 300mm rectangle.

              . Using the *Sewing Machine*, sew the 300mm long edges of the
              rectangle together. It should form a 300mm long sleeve.

              . Repeat the previous two steps for all of the remaining *Carbon
              Fiber Blanket* rectangles.

              . Take one of the *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve* parts and use
              *Scissors* to cut "X" shapes near the ends of the sleeve. The
              center of the "X" cuts should be approx. 20mm from each edge.

              . Repeat the above step for all of the remaining *Carbon Fiber
              Blanket Sleeve* parts.

              . The *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve* parts are complete.

            rubbing alcohol and a clean paper towel.
          - >-
            Halogen Lightbulb part(s) require special handling. Make sure to not
            touch the Halogen Lightbulb part(s) in the assembly with bare hands
            or they will be damaged during operation! The lifetime of a Halogen
            Lightbulb is reduced dramatically if operated while dirty.

              . If necessary, use the *Wire Strippers/Cutters* to strip the ends
              of all of the *Halogen Lightbulb Holder* wires.

              . Preheat the *Soldering Iron* to the operating temperature
              recommended by the *Electrical Solder* packaging.

              . Slide a *Heat Shrink Tubing* part(s) over one of the wires of a
              *Halogen Lightbulb Holder*.

              . Position one wire of one of the *Halogen Lightbulb Holder*
              part(s) and the wire with *Heat Shrink Tubing* from the previous
              step in the *Helping Hands* so that the exposed ends of the wires
              are touching. It may help to twist the wires together so that they
              stay in place during soldering.

              . Make sure that the *Heat Shrink Tubing* is out of the way of the
              exposed wire.

              . Hold the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* against the exposed
              wires in the *Helping Hands* for a few seconds to heat the wires.

              . Apply *Electrical Solder* to the contact point between the hot
              end of the *Soldering Iron* and the exposed wires until enough has
              been added to fuse the wires and make a good electrical
              connection.

              . Once the *Electrical Solder* has been applied, set the
              *Electrical Solder* aside and continue to hold the soldering iron
              to the soldered wires for a few seconds to allow the solder to
              flow up the wires.

              . Remove the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* from the wires.

              . Wait for the wires to cool and then remove them from the
              *Helping Hands*. 

              . Slide the *Heat Shrink Tubing* across the soldered area and use
              a *Heat Source* to shrink the *Heat Shrink Tubing* over the wires.

              . Take the other wire of one of the previously soldered *Halogen
              Lightbulb Holder* part(s), slide a *Heat Shrink Tubing* part(s)
              onto the wire, and position it in the *Helping Hands*.

              . Position one of the wires of the remaining *Halogen Lightbulb
              Holder* part(s) in the unused side of the *Helping Hands*.

              . Hold the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* against the exposed
              wires in the *Helping Hands* for a few seconds to heat the wires.

              . Apply *Electrical Solder* to the contact point between the hot
              end of the *Soldering Iron* and the exposed wires until enough has
              been added to fuse the wires and make a good electrical
              connection.

              . Once the *Electrical Solder* has been applied, set the
              *Electrical Solder* aside and continue to hold the soldering iron
              to the soldered wires for a few seconds to allow the solder to
              flow up the wires.

              . Remove the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* from the wires.

              . Wait for the wires to cool and then remove them from the
              *Helping Hands*.

              . Cut two pieces of the *Carbon Fiber Blanket* to size (75mm x
              75mm) using *Scissors*.

              . Wrap one piece of the *Carbon Fiber Blanket* over one of the
              *Heat Shrink Tubing* part(s).

              . Use two *Metal Zip Tie* part(s) to secure each end of the
              *Carbon Fiber Blanket* part(s). This should fully cover the *Heat
              Shrink Tubing*.

              . Perform the above steps again over the remaining *Heat Shrink
              Tubing* part(s).

              . Optionally, cut the excess *Metal Zip Tie* off using *Wire
              Strippers/Cutters*.

      - summary: Assemble Fast Heated Bed Module
        requiredParts: []
        requiredTools: []
        details: >
          . Slide one *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve* part(s) over one *Metal
          Conduit* so that the *Metal Conduit* is in the middle of the *Carbon
          Fiber Blanket Sleeve*.

          . Repeat the above step for the three other pairs of *Carbon Fiber
          Blanket Sleeve* part(s) and *Metal Conduit* part(s).

          . Orient the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate* so that the screws are on
          top.

          . Take one of the *Metal Conduit* / *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve*
          part(s) and align the "X" cuts on the ends of the *Carbon Fiber
          Blanket Sleeve* with two bolts on the side of the *Fast Heated Bed Top
          Plate*. 

          . Repeat the above step for all four sides of the *Fast Heated Bed Top
          Plate*.

          . Without touching the bulbs, place the *Halogen Lightbulb Assembly*
          onto the center of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

          . Pull the wires of the *Halogen Lightbulb Assembly* out past one side
          of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate* so that the wires can be reached in
          a later step.

          . Take four *M6 Nut* part(s) and screw one onto every screw on the
          *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

          . Position the *Fast Heated Bed Bottom Plate* onto the screws of the
          *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*. The *Fast Heated Bed Bottom Plate* should
          rest on top of the *M6 Nut* part(s) from the previous step.

          . Take four *M6 Nut* part(s) and screw one onto every screw on the
          *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate* above the *Fast Heated Bed Bottom Plate*.
          Tighten them down by hand; the final adjustment will take place later.

          . Gently flip the *Fast Heated Bed Module* over so that the *Fast
          Heated Bed Top Plate* is on top.

          . Take the *PEI Sheet* and peel away the corner of the covering of the
          adhesive side of the part

          . Align the exposed adhesive corner of the *PEI Sheet* with the
          machine cut side of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

          . Apply even and gentle pressure to the *PEI Sheet* to begin to stick
          it to the surface of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

          . While keeping the edges aligned, peel back more of the adhesive
          covering and apply more even pressure across the surface of the *PEI
          Sheet* until the *part* is fully adheared.

        If oils from skin contact or other debris get on the Halogen Lightbulb
        part(s) they can be cleaned while at room temperature with rubbing
        alcohol and a clean paper towel.
      - >-
        Halogen Lightbulb part(s) require special handling. Make sure to not
        touch the Halogen Lightbulb part(s) in the assembly with bare hands or
        they will be damaged during operation! The lifetime of a Halogen
        Lightbulb is reduced dramatically if operated while dirty.

          . If necessary, use the *Wire Strippers/Cutters* to strip the ends of
          all of the *Halogen Lightbulb Holder* wires.

          . Preheat the *Soldering Iron* to the operating temperature
          recommended by the *Electrical Solder* packaging.

          . Slide a *Heat Shrink Tubing* part(s) over one of the wires of a
          *Halogen Lightbulb Holder*.

          . Position one wire of one of the *Halogen Lightbulb Holder* part(s)
          and the wire with *Heat Shrink Tubing* from the previous step in the
          *Helping Hands* so that the exposed ends of the wires are touching. It
          may help to twist the wires together so that they stay in place during
          soldering.

          . Make sure that the *Heat Shrink Tubing* is out of the way of the
          exposed wire.

          . Hold the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* against the exposed wires
          in the *Helping Hands* for a few seconds to heat the wires.

          . Apply *Electrical Solder* to the contact point between the hot end
          of the *Soldering Iron* and the exposed wires until enough has been
          added to fuse the wires and make a good electrical connection.

          . Once the *Electrical Solder* has been applied, set the *Electrical
          Solder* aside and continue to hold the soldering iron to the soldered
          wires for a few seconds to allow the solder to flow up the wires.

          . Remove the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* from the wires.

          . Wait for the wires to cool and then remove them from the *Helping
          Hands*. 

          . Slide the *Heat Shrink Tubing* across the soldered area and use a
          *Heat Source* to shrink the *Heat Shrink Tubing* over the wires.

          . Take the other wire of one of the previously soldered *Halogen
          Lightbulb Holder* part(s), slide a *Heat Shrink Tubing* part(s) onto
          the wire, and position it in the *Helping Hands*.

          . Position one of the wires of the remaining *Halogen Lightbulb
          Holder* part(s) in the unused side of the *Helping Hands*.

          . Hold the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* against the exposed wires
          in the *Helping Hands* for a few seconds to heat the wires.

          . Apply *Electrical Solder* to the contact point between the hot end
          of the *Soldering Iron* and the exposed wires until enough has been
          added to fuse the wires and make a good electrical connection.

          . Once the *Electrical Solder* has been applied, set the *Electrical
          Solder* aside and continue to hold the soldering iron to the soldered
          wires for a few seconds to allow the solder to flow up the wires.

          . Remove the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* from the wires.

          . Wait for the wires to cool and then remove them from the *Helping
          Hands*.

          . Cut two pieces of the *Carbon Fiber Blanket* to size (75mm x 75mm)
          using *Scissors*.

          . Wrap one piece of the *Carbon Fiber Blanket* over one of the *Heat
          Shrink Tubing* part(s).

          . Use two *Metal Zip Tie* part(s) to secure each end of the *Carbon
          Fiber Blanket* part(s). This should fully cover the *Heat Shrink
          Tubing*.

          . Perform the above steps again over the remaining *Heat Shrink
          Tubing* part(s).

          . Optionally, cut the excess *Metal Zip Tie* off using *Wire
          Strippers/Cutters*.

          . Using *Paper Towels*, remove a *Halogen Lightbulb* part(s) from its
          packaging material and insert it into one of the *Halogen Lightbulb
          Holder* part(s). Be careful to not touch the *Halogen Lightbulb* with
          your hands (see precautions).

          . Repeat the above step for each of the other *Halogen Lightbulb
          Holder* part(s)*.

          . While following the *Circular Saw* manufacturer's instructions,
          install the *Cutoff Wheel* into the *Circular Saw*.

          . Affix the *Rebar Stake Stock Length* into the *Vise*, leaving enough
          *Rebar Stake Stock Length* sticking out to make the cut.

          . Mark the 450mm length on the *Rebar Stake Stock Length* using the
          *Measuring Tape* and *Permanent Marker*. Make sure that there is
          enough space marked for the width of the *Cutoff Wheel*!

          . Using the *Circular Saw*, make the cut on the *Rebar Stake Stock
          Length* where previously marked.

          . Repeat the above steps for all of the needed lengths of *Rebar
          Stake*.

          . Slide two *Linear Bearing* part(s) onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*.

          . Use the *Painters Tape* to evenly cover the *Linear Bearing* part(s)
          with around five layers of *Painters Tape*. Do this by applying the
          tape to both *Linear Bearing* part(s) and then rotating the part(s) on
          the *8mm Smooth Rod* until enough *Painters Tape* is applied.

          . Remove the *Linear Bearing* part(s) from the *8mm Smooth Rod*.

          . Remove some *Painters Tape* from the *Linear Bearing* part(s) using
          *Scissors* until the part(s) can fit into the holes of the *Universal
          Axis X Carriage Side*.

          . Test the fit of the *Linear Bearing* part(s) by covering the open
          end of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* with the *Carriage
          Closure* and then shaking the part. If the *Linear Bearing* part(s)
          move around inside of the *Carriage Closure* then the fit is too loose
          and more *Painters Tape* must be added to the *Linear Bearing*
          part(s).

          . Repeat the above step until the *Linear Bearing* part(s) fit into
          the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* without moving during the shake
          test.

          . Repeat all of the above steps for the other two *Linear Bearing*
          part(s).

          . Orient the *Carriage Closure* over the opening of the *Universal
          Axis X Carriage Side* so that the three mounting holes on the
          *Carriage Closure* line up with the mounting holes on the *Universal
          Axis X Carriage Side*. The flat side of the *Carriage Closure* should
          be facing away from the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* and the side
          with the indents for the *Linear Bearing* part(s) should be facing
          toward the opening of the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*.

          . Fix the *Carriage Closure* in place by using a *5mm Allen Wrench* to
          screw a *M6 x 20mm Screw* into the center hole of the *Carriage
          Closure*.

          . Orient the *Universal Axis Motor Side* such that the section of the
          stepper motor that hangs off of the *Universal Axis Motor Side* is
          pointing left.

          . Insert two *8mm Smooth Rod* part(s) into the right side of the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side* until the part(s) are flush with the left
          face of the plastic part.

          . Tighten down all six *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) on the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side*. This should fix the *8mm Smooth Rod*
          part(s) in place.

          . Slide the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*
          part(s) with the *Carriage Closure* facing _toward_ the *Universal
          Axis Motor Side*.

          . Slide the *Universal Axis Idler Side* onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*
          part(s) such that the larger opening on the *Universal Axis Idler
          Side* faces the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*.

          . Gently tighten down the *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) on the
          *Universal Axis Idler Side* to hold the *Universal Axis Idler Side* in
          place. The final position of the *Universal Axis Idler Side* will be
          adjusted in a later step.

          . Take the *GT2 Belt* and make a loop on one end with the teeth of the
          belt locking into one another.

          . Insert the loop into the side of the *Belt Peg* and use a *3mm Allen
          Wrench* to screw a *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) into the loop.

          . Thread the other end of the *GT2 Belt* through one of the openings
          on the *Universal Axis X Carriage Side* that is closer to the
          *Universal Axis Idler Side*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Motor
          Side*, around the pulley, and back through the *module*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the open slot in the
          *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Idler
          Side*, around the bearings, and back through the *module*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* back through the first slot of the
          *Universal Axis X Carriage Side*. Make sure that the *GT2 Belt* goes
          around the *Belt Peg* part in such a way that the part is positioned
          on the inside of the *GT2 Belt*.

          . Find the section of *GT2 Belt* that overlaps itself. This section
          will be coming out of the first slot of the *Universal Axis X Carriage
          Side*.

          . Take a *Belt Pinch* part and, while pulling the *GT2 Belt* tight by
          hand, slide the part over both sections of *GT2 Belt*.

          . Place a *M6 Nut* in the nut catcher of the *Belt Pinch*.

          . Push a *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the other side of the *Belt Pinch*.
          The part(s) may need to be wiggled while being pushed in.

          . Gently tighten down the *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the *M6 Nut* with
          a *5mm Allen Wrench*. The final belt tension will be adjusted in a
          later step.

          . The *Universal X Axis Module* is complete.

          . Slide two *Linear Bearing* part(s) onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*.

          . Use the *Painters Tape* to evenly cover the *Linear Bearing* part(s)
          with around five layers of *Painters Tape*. Do this by applying the
          tape to both *Linear Bearing* part(s) and then rotating the part(s) on
          the *8mm Smooth Rod* until enough *Painters Tape* is applied.

          . Remove the *Linear Bearing* part(s) from the *8mm Smooth Rod*.

          . Remove some *Painters Tape* from the *Linear Bearing* part(s) using
          *Scissors* until the part(s) can fit into the holes of the *Universal
          Axis Y1 Carriage Side*.

          . Test the fit of the *Linear Bearing* part(s) by covering the open
          end of the *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side* with the *Carriage
          Closure* and then shaking the part. If the *Linear Bearing* part(s)
          move around inside of the *Carriage Closure* then the fit is too loose
          and more *Painters Tape* must be added to the *Linear Bearing*
          part(s).

          . Repeat the above step until the *Linear Bearing* part(s) fit into
          the *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side* without moving during the shake
          test.

          . Repeat all of the above steps for the other two *Linear Bearing*
          part(s).

          . Orient the *Carriage Closure* over the opening of the *Universal
          Axis Y1 Carriage Side* so that the three mounting holes on the
          *Carriage Closure* line up with the mounting holes on the *Universal
          Axis Y1 Carriage Side*. The flat side of the *Carriage Closure* should
          be facing away from the *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side* and the side
          with the indents for the *Linear Bearing* part(s) should be facing
          toward the opening of the *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side*.

          . Fix the *Carriage Closure* in place by using a *5mm Allen Wrench* to
          screw a *M6 x 20mm Screw* into the center hole of the *Carriage
          Closure*.

          . Orient the *Universal Axis Motor Side* such that the section of the
          stepper motor that hangs off of the *Universal Axis Motor Side* is
          pointing left.

          . Insert two *8mm Smooth Rod* part(s) into the right side of the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side* until the part(s) are flush with the left
          face of the plastic part.

          . Tighten down all six *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) on the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side*. This should fix the *8mm Smooth Rod*
          part(s) in place.

          . Slide the *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side* onto the *8mm Smooth
          Rod* part(s) with the *Carriage Closure* facing _away_ _from_ the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side*.

          . Slide the *Universal Axis Idler Side* onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*
          part(s) such that the larger opening on the *Universal Axis Idler
          Side* faces the *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side*.

          . Gently tighten down the *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) on the
          *Universal Axis Idler Side* to hold the *Universal Axis Idler Side* in
          place. The final position of the *Universal Axis Idler Side* will be
          adjusted in a later step.

          . Take the *GT2 Belt* and make a loop on one end with the teeth of the
          belt locking into one another.

          . Insert the loop into the side of the *Belt Peg* and use a *3mm Allen
          Wrench* to screw a *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) into the loop.

          . Thread the other end of the *GT2 Belt* through one of the openings
          on the *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side* that is closer to the
          *Universal Axis Idler Side*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Motor
          Side*, around the pulley, and back through the *module*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the open slot in the
          *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Idler
          Side*, around the bearings, and back through the *module*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* back through the first slot of the
          *Universal Axis Y1 Carriage Side*. Make sure that the *GT2 Belt* goes
          around the *Belt Peg* part in such a way that the part is positioned
          on the inside of the *GT2 Belt*.

          . Find the section of *GT2 Belt* that overlaps itself. This section
          will be coming out of the first slot of the *Universal Axis Y1
          Carriage Side*.

          . Take a *Belt Pinch* part and, while pulling the *GT2 Belt* tight by
          hand, slide the part over both sections of *GT2 Belt*.

          . Place a *M6 Nut* in the nut catcher of the *Belt Pinch*.

          . Push a *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the other side of the *Belt Pinch*.
          The part(s) may need to be wiggled while being pushed in.

          . Gently tighten down the *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the *M6 Nut* with
          a *5mm Allen Wrench*. The final belt tension will be adjusted in a
          later step.

          . The *Universal Y1 Axis Module* is complete.

          . Slide two *Linear Bearing* part(s) onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*.

          . Use the *Painters Tape* to evenly cover the *Linear Bearing* part(s)
          with around five layers of *Painters Tape*. Do this by applying the
          tape to both *Linear Bearing* part(s) and then rotating the part(s) on
          the *8mm Smooth Rod* until enough *Painters Tape* is applied.

          . Remove the *Linear Bearing* part(s) from the *8mm Smooth Rod*.

          . Remove some *Painters Tape* from the *Linear Bearing* part(s) using
          *Scissors* until the part(s) can fit into the holes of the *Universal
          Axis Y2 Carriage Side*.

          . Test the fit of the *Linear Bearing* part(s) by covering the open
          end of the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* with the *Carriage
          Closure* and then shaking the part. If the *Linear Bearing* part(s)
          move around inside of the *Carriage Closure* then the fit is too loose
          and more *Painters Tape* must be added to the *Linear Bearing*
          part(s).

          . Repeat the above step until the *Linear Bearing* part(s) fit into
          the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* without moving during the shake
          test.

          . Repeat all of the above steps for the other two *Linear Bearing*
          part(s).

          . Orient the *Carriage Closure* over the opening of the *Universal
          Axis Y2 Carriage Side* so that the three mounting holes on the
          *Carriage Closure* line up with the mounting holes on the *Universal
          Axis Y2 Carriage Side*. The flat side of the *Carriage Closure* should
          be facing away from the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* and the side
          with the indents for the *Linear Bearing* part(s) should be facing
          toward the opening of the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side*.

          . Fix the *Carriage Closure* in place by using a *5mm Allen Wrench* to
          screw a *M6 x 20mm Screw* into the center hole of the *Carriage
          Closure*.

          . Orient the *Universal Axis Motor Side* such that the section of the
          stepper motor that hangs off of the *Universal Axis Motor Side* is
          pointing left.

          . Insert two *8mm Smooth Rod* part(s) into the right side of the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side* until the part(s) are flush with the left
          face of the plastic part.

          . Tighten down all six *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) on the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side*. This should fix the *8mm Smooth Rod*
          part(s) in place.

          . Slide the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* onto the *8mm Smooth
          Rod* part(s) with the *Carriage Closure* facing _away_ _from_ the
          *Universal Axis Motor Side*.

          . Slide the *Universal Axis Idler Side* onto the *8mm Smooth Rod*
          part(s) such that the larger opening on the *Universal Axis Idler
          Side* faces the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side*.

          . Gently tighten down the *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) on the
          *Universal Axis Idler Side* to hold the *Universal Axis Idler Side* in
          place. The final position of the *Universal Axis Idler Side* will be
          adjusted in a later step.

          . Take the *GT2 Belt* and make a loop on one end with the teeth of the
          belt locking into one another.

          . Insert the loop into the side of the *Belt Peg* and use a *3mm Allen
          Wrench* to screw a *M6 x 10mm Grub Screw* part(s) into the loop.

          . Thread the other end of the *GT2 Belt* through one of the openings
          on the *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side* that is closer to the
          *Universal Axis Idler Side*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Motor
          Side*, around the pulley, and back through the *module*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the open slot in the
          *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* through the *Universal Axis Idler
          Side*, around the bearings, and back through the *module*.

          . Thread the end of the *GT2 Belt* back through the first slot of the
          *Universal Axis Y2 Carriage Side*. Make sure that the *GT2 Belt* goes
          around the *Belt Peg* part in such a way that the part is positioned
          on the inside of the *GT2 Belt*.

          . Find the section of *GT2 Belt* that overlaps itself. This section
          will be coming out of the first slot of the *Universal Axis Y2
          Carriage Side*.

          . Take a *Belt Pinch* part and, while pulling the *GT2 Belt* tight by
          hand, slide the part over both sections of *GT2 Belt*.

          . Place a *M6 Nut* in the nut catcher of the *Belt Pinch*.

          . Push a *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the other side of the *Belt Pinch*.
          The part(s) may need to be wiggled while being pushed in.

          . Gently tighten down the *M6 x 20mm Screw* through the *M6 Nut* with
          a *5mm Allen Wrench*. The final belt tension will be adjusted in a
          later step.

          . Take two *Linear Bearing* part(s) and place them into the bearing
          holders on the **.

          . Loop one *Small Zip Tie* over each *Linear Bearing* part(s) and
          through the gap beneath the bearing holders to secure both *Linear
          Bearing* part(s) in place.

          . Pull each *Small Zip Tie* part(s) tight and cut off the excess
          *Small Zip Tie* material using *Scissors*.    

          . The *Universal Y2 Axis Module* is complete.

          end of the *Universal Axis Z Carriage Side* with the *Carriage
          Closure* and then shaking the part. If the *Linear Bearing* part(s)
          move around inside of the *Carriage Closure* then the fit is too loose
          and more *Painters Tape* must be added to the *Linear Bearing*
          part(s).

          +

          image:IMG_3643.jpeg[,300,300,pdfwidth=30%]

          . Orient the *Carriage Closure* over the opening of the *Universal
          Axis Z Carriage Side* so that the three mounting holes on the
          *Carriage Closure* line up with the mounting holes on the *Universal
          Axis Z Carriage Side*. The flat side of the *Carriage Closure* should
          be facing away from the *Universal Axis Z Carriage Side* and the side
          with the indents for the *Linear Bearing* part(s) should be facing
          toward the opening of the *Universal Axis Z Carriage Side*.

                  it forms a 40mm x 300mm rectangle.

                  . Using the *Sewing Machine*, sew the 300mm long edges of the
                  rectangle together. It should form a 300mm long sleeve.

                  . Repeat the previous two steps for all of the remaining
                  *Carbon Fiber Blanket* rectangles.

                  . Take one of the *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve* parts and use
                  *Scissors* to cut "X" shapes near the ends of the sleeve. The
                  center of the "X" cuts should be approx. 20mm from each edge.

              - >-
                Halogen Lightbulb part(s) require special handling. Make sure to
                not touch the Halogen Lightbulb part(s) in the assembly with
                bare hands or they will be damaged during operation! The
                lifetime of a Halogen Lightbulb is reduced dramatically if
                operated while dirty.

                  . If necessary, use the *Wire Strippers/Cutters* to strip the
                  ends of all of the *Halogen Lightbulb Holder* wires.

                  . Preheat the *Soldering Iron* to the operating temperature
                  recommended by the *Electrical Solder* packaging.

                  . Slide a *Heat Shrink Tubing* part(s) over one of the wires
                  of a *Halogen Lightbulb Holder*.

                  . Position one wire of one of the *Halogen Lightbulb Holder*
                  part(s) and the wire with *Heat Shrink Tubing* from the
                  previous step in the *Helping Hands* so that the exposed ends
                  of the wires are touching. It may help to twist the wires
                  together so that they stay in place during soldering.

                  . Make sure that the *Heat Shrink Tubing* is out of the way of
                  the exposed wire.

                  . Hold the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* against the exposed
                  wires in the *Helping Hands* for a few seconds to heat the
                  wires.

                  . Apply *Electrical Solder* to the contact point between the
                  hot end of the *Soldering Iron* and the exposed wires until
                  enough has been added to fuse the wires and make a good
                  electrical connection.

                  . Once the *Electrical Solder* has been applied, set the
                  *Electrical Solder* aside and continue to hold the soldering
                  iron to the soldered wires for a few seconds to allow the
                  solder to flow up the wires.

                  . Remove the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* from the wires.

                  . Wait for the wires to cool and then remove them from the
                  *Helping Hands*. 

                  . Slide the *Heat Shrink Tubing* across the soldered area and
                  use a *Heat Source* to shrink the *Heat Shrink Tubing* over
                  the wires.

                  . Take the other wire of one of the previously soldered
                  *Halogen Lightbulb Holder* part(s), slide a *Heat Shrink
                  Tubing* part(s) onto the wire, and position it in the *Helping
                  Hands*.

                  . Position one of the wires of the remaining *Halogen
                  Lightbulb Holder* part(s) in the unused side of the *Helping
                  Hands*.

                  . Hold the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* against the exposed
                  wires in the *Helping Hands* for a few seconds to heat the
                  wires.

                  . Apply *Electrical Solder* to the contact point between the
                  hot end of the *Soldering Iron* and the exposed wires until
                  enough has been added to fuse the wires and make a good
                  electrical connection.

                  . Once the *Electrical Solder* has been applied, set the
                  *Electrical Solder* aside and continue to hold the soldering
                  iron to the soldered wires for a few seconds to allow the
                  solder to flow up the wires.

                  . Remove the hot end of the *Soldering Iron* from the wires.

                  . Wait for the wires to cool and then remove them from the
                  *Helping Hands*.

              . Slide one *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve* part(s) over one *Metal
              Conduit* so that the *Metal Conduit* is in the middle of the
              *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve*.

              . Repeat the above step for the three other pairs of *Carbon Fiber
              Blanket Sleeve* part(s) and *Metal Conduit* part(s).

              . Orient the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate* so that the screws are on
              top.

              . Take one of the *Metal Conduit* / *Carbon Fiber Blanket Sleeve*
              part(s) and align the "X" cuts on the ends of the *Carbon Fiber
              Blanket Sleeve* with two bolts on the side of the *Fast Heated Bed
              Top Plate*. 

              . Repeat the above step for all four sides of the *Fast Heated Bed
              Top Plate*.

              . Without touching the bulbs, place the *Halogen Lightbulb
              Assembly* onto the center of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

              . Pull the wires of the *Halogen Lightbulb Assembly* out past one
              side of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate* so that the wires can be
              reached in a later step.

              . Take four *M6 Nut* part(s) and screw one onto every screw on the
              *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

              . Position the *Fast Heated Bed Bottom Plate* onto the screws of
              the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*. The *Fast Heated Bed Bottom
              Plate* should rest on top of the *M6 Nut* part(s) from the
              previous step.

              . Take four *M6 Nut* part(s) and screw one onto every screw on the
              *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate* above the *Fast Heated Bed Bottom
              Plate*. Tighten them down by hand; the final adjustment will take
              place later.

              . Gently flip the *Fast Heated Bed Module* over so that the *Fast
              Heated Bed Top Plate* is on top.

              . Take the *PEI Sheet* and peel away the corner of the covering of
              the adhesive side of the part

              . Align the exposed adhesive corner of the *PEI Sheet* with the
              machine cut side of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

              . Apply even and gentle pressure to the *PEI Sheet* to begin to
              stick it to the surface of the *Fast Heated Bed Top Plate*.

              . While keeping the edges aligned, peel back more of the adhesive
              covering and apply more even pressure across the surface of the
              *PEI Sheet* until the *part* is fully adheared.

                  . While following the *Circular Saw* manufacturer's
                  instructions, install the *Cutoff Wheel* into the *Circular
                  Saw*.

                  . Affix the *Rebar Stake Stock Length* into the *Vise*,
                  leaving enough *Rebar Stake Stock Length* sticking out to make
                  the cut.

                  . Mark the 450mm length on the *Rebar Stake Stock Length*
                  using the *Measuring Tape* and *Permanent Marker*. Make sure
                  that there is enough space marked for the width of the *Cutoff
                  Wheel*!

                  . Using the *Circular Saw*, make the cut on the *Rebar Stake
                  Stock Length* where previously marked.

                  . Repeat the above steps for all of the needed lengths of
                  *Rebar Stake*.
